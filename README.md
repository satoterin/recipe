# Recipe Finder Application

This application is a recipe finder that allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients they have on hand, dietary restrictions, and meal types. It utilizes the Spoonacular API for recipe data and OpenAI's GPT model for enhanced recipe summaries.

## Main Functionalities

1. **Recipe Search**: Users can search for recipes by entering ingredients they have available. The search can be further refined by specifying dietary restrictions and meal types.

2. **Filtering Options**: 
   - Ingredients: Required field for recipe search
   - Dietary Restrictions: Optional field (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free)
   - Meal Type: Optional selection (breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc.)

3. **Recipe Details**: Users can view detailed information about each recipe, including:
   - Title and image
   - List of ingredients
   - Step-by-step cooking instructions
   - Recipe summary (enhanced by AI)

4. **Pagination**: The application supports pagination for browsing through multiple recipe results.

5. **Responsive Design**: The user interface is designed to be responsive and work well on various device sizes.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with React
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **API Integration**: 
  - Spoonacular API for recipe data
  - OpenAI API for generating enhanced recipe summaries
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form for efficient form management
- **HTTP Requests**: Axios for API calls

## Setup and Configuration

To run this application, you need to set up the following environment variables:

- `SPOONACULAR_API_KEY`: Your Spoonacular API key
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: The base URL for your API endpoints

Create a .env file and ensure these are properly configured in it before running the application.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up your environment variables
   - set `SPOONACULAR_API_KEY` in `.env` file
   - set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` file
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application in your browser.

## Chanllenges
- I worked on several Nextjs projects 2 years before, but this was the first time I worked on a project that uses Nextjs v13+. The routing mechanism has been changed since v13, and I had to spend some time to figure it out. It was somewhat frustrating but I learned a lot from it.

- Fetching the recipe information from the Spoonacular API is limited to 100 requests per day. After working and testing the project for a while, the project started not working and I had to figure out why. It turned out that the API key was blocked for too many requests. I had to generate a new API key. However, I knew that I have to reduce the api hit times as less as possible.

- I had encountered similar issue when using openai api and I figured out the problem immediately at this time.
- First, I fetched the ai response of the recipe description in the same api route as the recipe information. However, I found that the api call was too slow and I had to move the ai response fetching to a separate api route.

## AI tools used
- I used Cursor AI to write the code and to generate the README file. It is a very good tool for writing code. 
- Most of the html code was generated by Cursor AI. 
- Most of the react components were generated by Cursor AI. 
- Most of the comments were generated by Cursor AI.
